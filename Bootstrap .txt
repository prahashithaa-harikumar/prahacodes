**Introduction**

"Good day, everyone! We are the Credit Card Onboarding Team from URSA. I’m Prahashithaa, here with Sanjay R Krishna, Kavyasri, Harshit, and Sounyayojtu. We're excited to walk you through our project."

---

**Slide 1: Feature Implementation Summary**

"We prioritized seven key user stories for credit card onboarding. From user login and application submission to document handling and credit checks, all critical features have been implemented. Additionally, we integrated automated notifications and report generation as a nice-to-have feature."

---

**Slide 2: Internal Workflow**

"The process begins with user login to NGOS, followed by customer profile prescreening and credit card application creation. After a bureau credit check, core banking data is retrieved to initiate offers. Approved applications go through document verification, with final notifications sent to customers about card issuance and shipping."

**Slide 3: Project Highlights**

"Key highlights include restricting sales users’ access to their own applications, mock-generating CIBIL scores with Faker, and using Selenium for automated testing. We also enabled Excel report extraction for applications."

---

**Slide 4: Technical Implementation Details**

"Our front-end was developed using React, Chakra UI, and Tailwind CSS. We built 25 REST APIs using Spring Boot, stored data in PostgreSQL, and managed development via Azure Boards and Git."

---

**Slide 5: Secure Code Practices**

"Security practices include input validation, file encryption, JWT authentication, and password encryption to ensure data security."

---

**Slide 6: Challenges, Learnings, and Next Steps**

"Challenges like limited data for credit scores and JWT configuration helped us improve our skills in React, REST APIs, and testing. Next, we aim to add two-step verification, email automation, alternative card suggestions, and Captcha for added security."

"That wraps up the summary. Thank you!"
